# 🎯 SIMPLIFIED DEPLOYMENT ANALYSIS

## 🚀 **MINIMAL VIABLE INFRASTRUCTURE**

### ✅ **CORE REQUIREMENTS** (Policy + Function):
1. **VNet + Subnet** - Policy requirement (FREE)
2. **Container Apps Environment** - Private hosting (FREE base)  
3. **Container App** - Main application (~$15/month)

### 🤔 **OPTIONAL COMPONENTS** (Can be simplified):
4. **PostgreSQL** - Keep for production (~$50/month)
5. **Storage Account** - Keep for file uploads (~$5/month)
6. **Container Registry** - Keep for security (~$5/month)

### ❌ **REMOVE FOR SIMPLICITY**:
7. **Log Analytics** - Use basic Container Apps logs (Save ~$30/month)
8. **Managed Identity** - Use environment secrets instead (Reduce complexity)

## 💰 **COST COMPARISON**:
- **Current Template:** ~$100-120/month
- **Simplified:** ~$75/month  
- **Savings:** 25-40% cost reduction

## 🎯 **NEXT ACTION**:
Should I create a simplified template removing Log Analytics and Managed Identity?
This would make deployment faster and reduce complexity while maintaining all required functionality.
