# HSQ Forms Platform - Deployment Status

## Production Environment - **Last Updated**: 2025-06-02  
**Deployment Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**

Core functionality is deployed and operational. The file upload functionality has been deployed but requires additional verification.

### 🔄 Remaining Tasks:

1. **Verify file upload endpoints**: The API appears to be registered correctly, but the endpoints are not accessible.
2. **Check container app revision**: Ensure the latest revision with file handling code is active.
3. **Test frontend file upload**: Verify that the contact and support forms can upload files successfully.
4. **Update API documentation**: Update the root endpoint to show file endpoints as active.e Container Apps
