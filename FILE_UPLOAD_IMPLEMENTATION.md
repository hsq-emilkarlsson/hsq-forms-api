# File Upload Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Backend Infrastructure

   - Created comprehensive `blob_storage.py` with security features
   - Implemented Managed Identity authentication
   - Added file type validation, size limits, and content analysis
   - Included proper cleanup mechanisms

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `/files/upload/{submission_id}` - Upload files to submission
   - `/files/submission/{submission_id}` - List files for submission  
   - `/files/{file_id}` - Download file
   - `/files/{file_id}/info` - Get file metadata

4. **Dependencies**
   - Added Azure packages to `requirements.txt`:
     - `azure-storage-blob==12.19.0`
     - `azure-identity==1.15.0` 
     - `python-magic==0.4.27`

### Frontend Integration
1. **Feedback Form** (`form-feedback`)
   - ‚úÖ FileUpload component integrated into App.tsx
   - ‚úÖ File upload appears after successful form submission
   - ‚úÖ Upload results display with success/error messages
   - ‚úÖ CSS styling added for file upload section

2. **Support Form** (`form-support`)
   - ‚úÖ FileUpload component copied and integrated
   - ‚úÖ Same functionality as feedback form
   - ‚úÖ Appropriate context messaging for support tickets
   - ‚úÖ CSS styling added

3. **Component Features**
   - Drag and drop file selection
   - File type validation (images, PDF, Office docs, text)
   - File size validation (10MB limit)
   - Progress tracking during upload
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Multiple file support (up to 5 files)

## üîß NEXT STEPS (Required for Production)

### 1. Azure Storage Account Setup
```bash
# Create Azure Storage Account
az storage account create \
  --name hsqformstorage \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --location westeurope \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  --kind StorageV2

# Create blob container
az storage container create \
  --name file-attachments \
  --account-name hsqformstorage \
  --public-access off
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Add to Azure Container Apps environment variables:
```env
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=hsqformstorage
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=file-attachments
# Managed Identity will handle authentication
```

### 3. Managed Identity Setup
```bash
# Assign Managed Identity to Container App
az containerapp identity assign \
  --name hsq-forms-api \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --system-assigned

# Grant Storage Blob Data Contributor role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee <managed-identity-principal-id> \
  --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
  --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/hsqformstorage
```

### 4. Container Image Updates
```bash
# Rebuild and push API container with file upload support
cd apps/app
docker build -t hsqformsapi:latest .
docker tag hsqformsapi:latest <registry>/hsqformsapi:latest
docker push <registry>/hsqformsapi:latest

# Rebuild frontend containers with file upload UI
cd ../form-feedback
docker build -t hsqformfeedback:latest .
docker tag hsqformfeedback:latest <registry>/hsqformfeedback:latest
docker push <registry>/hsqformfeedback:latest

cd ../form-support
docker build -t hsqformsupport:latest .
docker tag hsqformsupport:latest <registry>/hsqformsupport:latest
docker push <registry>/hsqformsupport:latest
```

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Local Testing (Completed)
- [x] Database migration runs successfully
- [x] Forms display without TypeScript errors
- [x] File upload component loads correctly
- [x] File upload section appears after form submission

### Production Testing (Pending)
- [ ] Test file upload with Azure Blob Storage
- [ ] Verify Managed Identity authentication
- [ ] Test file download functionality
- [ ] Verify file type and size validation
- [ ] Test file listing for submissions
- [ ] Test error handling for upload failures

## üìÅ FILES MODIFIED

### Backend
- `apps/app/app/models.py` - Added FileAttachment model
- `apps/app/app/blob_storage.py` - New Azure Blob Storage service
- `apps/app/app/schemas.py` - Added file upload schemas  
- `apps/app/app/routers/files.py` - New file upload router
- `apps/app/app/main.py` - Added file router to FastAPI app
- `apps/app/requirements.txt` - Added Azure dependencies
- `apps/app/alembic/versions/3e7f1234abcd_add_file_attachments_table.py` - New migration

### Frontend
- `apps/form-feedback/src/App.tsx` - Integrated FileUpload component
- `apps/form-feedback/src/App.css` - Added file upload styles
- `apps/form-feedback/src/FileUpload.tsx` - Existing component (no changes)
- `apps/form-support/src/App.tsx` - Integrated FileUpload component  
- `apps/form-support/src/App.css` - Added file upload styles
- `apps/form-support/src/FileUpload.tsx` - Copied from feedback form
- `apps/form-support/src/FileUpload.css` - Copied from feedback form

## üîí SECURITY FEATURES

- **File Type Validation**: Only allows specific file types (images, PDF, Office docs, text)
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum per file, 5 files maximum per submission
- **Content Analysis**: Uses python-magic for file type verification
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Secure cloud storage with private access
- **Managed Identity**: Secure authentication without storing credentials
- **Unique File Names**: UUIDs prevent file name conflicts and path traversal

## üí° USAGE

1. User fills out feedback or support form
2. After successful submission, file upload section appears
3. User can drag/drop or select files (up to 5 files, 10MB each)
4. Files are validated and uploaded to Azure Blob Storage
5. Upload results are displayed with success/error messages
6. Files are linked to the form submission in the database

The implementation follows Azure best practices and provides a secure, scalable file upload solution for the HSQ Forms Platform.
